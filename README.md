The first question asks whether you want to create a new panel or modify existing panels in the account.

Then logs into your Cloudflare account, return to the terminal and asks you a series of questions.

If you choose option 1, it will ask a series of configuration questions. You can use the default values or input your own. In the end, it opens the panel for you in your browser â€” thatâ€™s it.

> [!TIP]
> For each setting it asks about, it has already generated a secure, personal value for you. You can simply press Enter to accept it and move on to the next question, or input your own values.

If you choose option 2, it lists deployed Workers and Pages projects and you can choose which one to modify.

## Updating Panel

Just run wizard and select option 2 for the first question. It will show you a list of project names in your account â€” you can choose any to update to the latest stable version or delete.
